## Game Description
The game is similar to drawing cards with values ranging from one up to eleven. Players take turns to draw cards, and the face value of the card drawn is summed up to the total points. If the total value of any of the players crosses 21 then the respective player is out. The game is presented on a seven-segment display, where the current values on the card are shown, and whether the player has won or lost. The game has a feature of auto-generation after each win or loss, so the child can play it repeatedly. 

## Gameplay
To start the game, we press and release the 0 push button. And a random number from 1 to 11 comes up. We press and release the 0 button until we get 21. The numbers of the incoming cards are added up and the total is reflected on the seven-segment display. For win condition; When the total reaches 21, 21 flashes on the seven-segment display and the LEDs blink. For lose condition; When the total exceeds 21, LOSE text is displayed on the seven-segment display.
